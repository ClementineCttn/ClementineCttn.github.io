## Most recent {#publi-recent}

- [@cottineau2025urban]: In this entry, Denise Pumain and I propose a definition of urban inequality. We also present the history of the concept, its central relevance for geography, regional science and urban policy.

- [@cottineau2025citysize]: In this chapter, I present an overview of patterns and regularities in city size distributions. Starting from a short history of early findings, I go on to present Zipf’s contribution, the plethora of empirical material which can be interpreted as a confirmation of the law and some models generating such a regular distribution. The deviations from the law and recent propositions to advance the study of urbanisation “beyond Zipf’s law” are also presented. 

- [@san_millan_economic_2025]: In this paper, we compute income inequality and residential segregation annually in all urban areas of the Netherlands from 2011 to 2022 and show they have remained stable or decreased in most cities. We analyse how income is distributed by percentile of the income distribution, how each percentile is segregated and at which geographical scale segregation occurs in different cities. Urban areas vary strongly: more unequal urban areas tend to be more segregated, but the same segregation levels can coexist with diverse inequality metrics.

- [@cottineau2025evaluer]: In this chapter, we reflect on the specificity of peer-review for data papers, with the experience gathered from Cybergeo, a scientific open access journal publishing geography articles, where a section dedicated to data papers was created in 2017.

- [@roxburg2025outlining]: In this piece, we propose a list of features that would greatly enhance population synthesis methods from the perspective of agent-based modelling. These include, but are not limited to: the attributes of agents, their location in space, the ways they make decisions and their behavioural dynamics. In the real-world, these aspects of everyday human life can be deeply interconnected, with these associations being highly consequential in shaping outcomes. Initialising synthetic populations in ways that fail to respect these covariances can therefore compromise model efficacy, potentially leading to biased and inaccurate simulation outcomes.
