-   [@cottineau2024generative]: This piece is a manifesto on desirable future paths for generative modelling in the field of spatial analysis
-   [@cottineau2024unforeseen]: In this article, we analyse the ways in which analytical urban models circulate, in light of the diversity of their objectives, the circumstances in which they were produced and the economic or political interests expressed by their users.
-   [@askenazy2024geography]: In here, P. Askenazy and I looked at the structure of bargaining within multi-establishment firms and whether the level chosen depends on the geography of the firm.
-   [@achter2024conduct]: This meta-review identifies past and present trends in how Agent-Based Models (ABMs) are reviewed and how they address theory development
